# Suicidal-rate-from-1985-to-2015
This is a project that consist of data from 1985 to 2015 suicidal rate in the entire world. Hence, we will be doing some visualization on the data in order to study the insights that has been provided by the data set and try to predict the reason.

Suicide Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze data related to suicide rates across various countries and demographic groups. The analysis is conducted using Python and involves the following steps:

Data Loading and Initial Inspection: The dataset is loaded and inspected to understand its structure and contents.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations.
Modeling: Applying machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, to predict suicide rates based on various factors.
Dataset
The dataset (master.csv) includes information on suicide rates across different countries, years, age groups, and other demographic factors.

Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling.
